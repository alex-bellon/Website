			<p>I am primarily interested in cybersecurity, privacy and open source. I like to participate in online Capture the Flag challenges (CTFs) with United Texas Coalition (UTC), as well as on my own. I am also the Co-President of UT's cybersecurity organization, <a href='https://www.isss.io/'>Information and Systems Society (ISSS)</a>, where I write CTF challenges for the bi-weekly CTFs that we host. As captain of UT's <a href='https://www.nationalccdc.org/'>Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC)</a> and <a href='https://nationalcptc.org/'>Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC)</a> team, I compete as part of the blue and red teams to secure services and machines in a simulated environment. I also used to TA for CS361: Introduction to Security, where I wrote and graded assignments, gave lectures and held office hours. </p>
			<p>In terms of software development, for 2 years I did frontend work as the VP Webmaster for UT's chapter of ACM, and as one of the Webmasters for <a href="http://waitlisters.org">'The Waitlisters'</a>. As part of the Waitlisters, I also attend lots of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathons</a> where I do backend work for webapps, usually working in Python and SQL.</p>
			<p> Outside of computer science, I like to do graphic design and photography to keep creative and take breaks from coding. I also enjoy the performing arts, and go to see every Broadway show that comes to UT at the Bass Concert Hall. To keep active, I like to go bouldering as well as play intramural soccer and longboard. </p>
