          <h2><a href="http://www.nationalccdc.org/">CCDC</a></h2>
          <p>I am the Captain of UT's Collegiate Cybersecurity Defense Competition (CCDC) team. In CCDC, teams of 8 students must defend 8-10 machines from red team attackers while also completing business 'injects' (like setting up new services, managing users, etc.). As captain, I delegate tasks and work on any extra injects that need help. At the Southwest Regional we have placed 2nd ('19) and 3rd ('20) place.</p>

					<h2><a href="https://nationalcptc.org/">CPTC</a></h2>
					<p>I am the Co-Captain of UT's Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) team. CPTC is a competition where teams of 6 students are tasked with performing a comprehensive penetration test for a fake company, and then delivering a detailed report of the vulnerabilities and security flaws they found. This past season, my team placed 2nd at the New England Regionals.</p>

I write problems and challenges for the CTFs we hold every two weeks, and hold talks about introductory security topics. I manage an officer team of 15, and we have 100+ members. We also hold a yearly international CTF called UTCTF that has 1200+ competitors from all over the globe (I lead this project in 2020). </p>
