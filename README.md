Website last updated on: September 2 2018

Source code for my personal website <a href="http://alex.waitlisters.org">alex.waitlisters.org</a>. I wrote the website myself except for the <a href="https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop">tabletop</a> (allows HTML content to be drawn from a Google Spreadsheet) and <a href="https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/">particles</a> (fancy background animation [currently not working]) parts.
